## 💬 about me:

Hey, I'm Pedro-Ryan 👋
I enjoy back-end development and understanding how things work behind the code.

I like to learn slowly, testing, making mistakes, and improving little by little. I prefer to understand the fundamentals well, write organized code, and evolve through practical projects.

I use Linux daily, I work a lot with the terminal, and I'm always exploring new tools, concepts, and ideas. Here on GitHub you'll find study projects, tests, experiments, and things you'll build over time.
